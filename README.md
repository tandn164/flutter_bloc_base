# Flutter FFCA Base

A multi-app Flutter workspace built with Feature-First Clean Architecture, BLoC,
and app-owned composition. Reusable business capabilities live in `features/`;
reusable technical capabilities live in `shared/`; `sample_app` only selects and
wires them.

The package boundaries follow the VGV-style dependency direction:

```text
Presentation ─────▶ Domain ◀───── Data
 Flutter/BLoC       pure Dart      API/DTO/storage

                    ▲
                    │ composed by
                 apps/<app>
```

## Goals

- Select a different feature set for each app at build time.
- Customize routes, branding, copy, SDKs, and UX without forking domain logic.
- Keep business logic independent from Flutter, HTTP, routing, and service locators.
- Make offline, auth, overlays, logging, responsive UI, and tooling reusable.
- Avoid generic `core` packages and empty layers created only to fill a diagram.

```

Every reusable package has an English README describing its public API,
composition, safety rules, and tests. Start with the package README rather than
copying code out of `sample_app`.

## Ownership rules

- Domain is pure Dart and owns entities, repository contracts, and use cases.
- Data implements Domain and owns DTO/API/persistence details.
- Presentation depends on Domain, never Data; business/UI classes do not look up services through GetIt.
- Shared packages never import business features.
- Packages own generated internal DI. Apps own the GetIt container, module selection,
  GoRouter, flavors, theme, native configuration, and implementation choices.
- A feature package does not know which route, tab, overlay, or app uses it.
- A third-party provider SDK is hidden behind a domain/shared contract and selected by the app.

Boundary tests in `sample_app` enforce these rules and verify that every workspace
package includes a README.

## Feature composition

The app selects feature dependencies directly in `lib/app/di.dart` and routes
or shell branches directly in `lib/app/router/app_router.dart`. There is no
separate feature manifest. Each app-owned feature has a folder under
`lib/app/features/<name>/`: `<name>_di.dart` selects package DI modules and
`<name>_routes.dart` owns routes and presentation callbacks. Generated companions
stay beside their source. Route-only features do not need an empty DI file.

Use cases may use Injectable annotations while remaining Flutter-independent.
See [Dependency injection](tool/DEPENDENCY_INJECTION.md) for module selection,
repository replacement, lifecycle rules and the package/app boundary.

To add a feature to an app:

```bash
make new-feature NAME=orders APP=sample_app
make new-feature NAME=news APP=sample_app DATA=memory-cache
make new-feature NAME=feed APP=sample_app DATA=persistent-cache
make new-feature NAME=tasks APP=sample_app DATA=offline-first
make new-feature NAME=drafts APP=sample_app DATA=local
```

Or manually:

1. Add the required Domain/Data/Presentation packages to the app `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Create `lib/app/features/<name>/` with separate DI and route files.
3. Call its dependency initializer in `di.dart` and include its routes/branch in
   `app_router.dart`. For a tab, also add the matching destination in `app_shell.dart`.
4. Run `make get`, `make codegen`, `make lint`, and `make test`.

To scaffold a new app:

```bash
make new-app NAME=merchant_app
```

To remove a scaffolded app:

```bash
CONFIRM=1 make delete-app NAME=merchant_app
```

`sample_app` is protected because it is the reference implementation. Once a
different app exists, it can be removed explicitly:

```bash
CONFIRM=1 ALLOW_DELETE_SAMPLE=1 make delete-app NAME=sample_app
```

The last remaining app cannot be deleted. If the deleted app was the Makefile
default, another app is selected as the new default.

To remove a scaffolded feature (protects `auth`, `sample`, `profile`, `onboarding`):

```bash
CONFIRM=1 make delete-feature NAME=orders APP=sample_app
```

See [tool/scaffold/README.md](tool/scaffold/README.md) for options such as
`ROUTE_KIND=tab`, `WIRE=0`, and `delete-feature`.

## Adopt into a product repo

This repository ships with a **canonical workspace slug**: `flutter_ffca_base`.
That slug appears in workspace metadata, native bundle IDs, env defaults, and
display names so the base stays identifiable while you evaluate it.

When you clone or fork the base for a **real product**, run the adopt script
**once** at the start of the product repo. It renames `flutter_ffca_base` to
your product package name everywhere the slug is used.

```bash
# Preview (prints the confirmation command, changes nothing)
make adopt-project PACKAGE=acme_merchant

# Apply
CONFIRM=1 make adopt-project PACKAGE=acme_merchant TITLE="Acme Merchant"
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PACKAGE` | yes | Product slug in `snake_case` (e.g. `acme_merchant`) |
| `TITLE` | no | Human-readable app title; defaults from `PACKAGE` |
| `CONFIRM=1` | yes to apply | Without it, the script only prints instructions |

**Example mapping** (`PACKAGE=acme_merchant`, `TITLE="Acme Merchant"`):

| Before (base) | After (product) |
| --- | --- |
| `flutter_ffca_base_workspace` | `acme_merchant_workspace` |
| `flutter_ffca_base` (iOS display name, env slug, …) | `acme_merchant` |
| `Flutter FFCA Base` | `Acme Merchant` |
| `com.company.flutter_ffca_base` (Android `applicationId`) | `com.company.acme_merchant` |
| `com.company.flutter_ffca_base` (Android namespace / Kotlin) | `com.company.acme_merchant` |
| `com.company.flutterFfcaBase` (iOS bundle ID) | `com.company.acmeMerchant` |

The script also moves the Kotlin `MainActivity` package folder, renames the
root `.iml` module when present, and runs `dart pub get`.

**After adopt:**

1. Review `git diff` — the rename touches many files.
2. Update Android/iOS **signing** and store listings if bundle IDs changed.
3. Restart Android Studio so run configurations refresh.
4. Continue with `make init APP=sample_app` (or your app folder under `apps/`).

**Low-level entry point** (custom slug renames only):

```bash
CONFIRM=1 bash tool/rename_project_slug.sh \
  FROM_SLUG=flutter_ffca_base \
  TO_SLUG=acme_merchant \
  FROM_TITLE="Flutter FFCA Base" \
  TO_TITLE="Acme Merchant"
```

Implementation: [`tool/adopt_project.sh`](tool/adopt_project.sh),
[`tool/rename_project_slug.sh`](tool/rename_project_slug.sh).

**Note:** `make adopt-project` renames the **workspace/product slug**, not an
individual app folder under `apps/`. Use `make new-app` to add product apps and
keep `sample_app` as the reference composition or trim it later.

## Reusable UX capabilities

### Data strategies

The base keeps the choice visible in each feature repository instead of hiding
it in the HTTP client:

- **No cache:** always call the remote datasource. See `service_catalog`.
- **Short memory cache:** wrap remote reads with `MemoryTtlCache`; TTL is owned
  by the feature. See `announcements`.
- **Offline-first:** Drift/SQLite is the local source of truth; observe local data,
  write locally first, then synchronize with remote. See `work_orders`.

`api_client` handles transport and safe decoding only. A feature can replace its
remote adapter with Chopper, Firestore, Realtime Database, or MongoDB without
changing its domain contract. Retry queues are feature commands, not serialized
HTTP requests; idempotent server operations remain required for at-least-once
delivery.

### App-wide overlays

`app_overlay` hosts loading, toast, no-internet, and tutorial layers above the
router, so overlays survive screen disposal and can cover navigation and bottom
bars. Loading uses idempotent handles, toast delivery is queued, deduplicated,
and shown one at a time in a fixed slot. The center loading content is
replaceable. `PageConfig` can inherit the app
offline policy or override it per screen.

### Auth and navigation

`SessionRoutePolicy` supports guest-only, guest-optional, and auth-required apps.
`AuthInterceptor` performs a single shared refresh for concurrent 401s,
retries the request, and only kicks the session after a confirmed auth failure.
GoRouter owns app routes and universal/deep-link parsing; features receive
navigation callbacks.

### UI foundations

`ui_kit` uses breakpoints, clamped values, and minimum interactive sizes instead
of scaling every dimension from a design canvas. It includes adaptive
NavigationBar/NavigationRail, reusable skeleton primitives, and typed validation
rules whose messages are localized by the app.

### Logs and push

`app_logging` queues user actions and redacted API metadata, delivers batches
serially in the background, and never awaits network logging on the UI action.
`app_push` is provider-neutral and exposes foreground presentation, permission,
badge, and payload contracts; an app adds Firebase/APNs/another provider adapter
only when required.

## Sample app

`sample_app` demonstrates composition, not a second framework layer. It retains
only app-specific concerns: bootstrap, dependency composition, router, theme, flavors,
native projects, and a capability showcase UI. Buttons demonstrate reusable
overlays, connectivity policies, skeletons, validation, logging, deep links,
and onboarding. The Sample list is a complete FFCA example for pagination,
pull-to-refresh, and mutations, backed by an explicit local repository rather
than a fake HTTP server.

Run it with:

```bash
make run
make run APP=sample_app FLAVOR=stg
```

Supported flavors are `dev`, `stg`, and `prod`.

## Environment setup

The toolchain contract lives in `tool/toolchain.env`, `.fvmrc`, and
`.ruby-version`. Flutter is selected through FVM; Ruby is selected per project
through rbenv, without replacing the macOS system Ruby or changing another
repository's version.

```bash
make doctor   # report missing or mismatched tools
make init     # offer to install prerequisites, select Flutter/Ruby, get, generate, validate
```

Bootstrap asks before installing host tools. Xcode installation or switching is
never silent because it affects the whole macOS machine.

## Build and release

See [Code generation](tool/CODE_GENERATION.md) for Freezed/JSON, feature-local DI,
typed routes, scaffold conventions, watch mode and CI validation.

For a first Firebase upload, place the Google Service config in the selected
flavor folder, then authenticate with `firebase login` (Firebase CLI) **or** a
service-account credential. The config identifies the app; it does not grant
upload permission. App ID overrides are optional. Follow the
[first-time Firebase setup guide](tool/release/README.md#first-time-firebase-setup)
before your first release; the wizard checks Firebase access before building.

```bash
make release
```

The interactive release script asks for platform, flavor, build name, build
number, destination, and signing mode. The wizard delegates build and upload to
the app's Fastlane lanes and can also run non-interactively in CI. Supported
destinations:

- Android APK/App Bundle export and Firebase App Distribution.
- iOS IPA export, Firebase App Distribution, TestFlight internal/external, and
  App Store upload.
- iOS automatic signing or Fastlane Match-based certificate signing.

The script does not publish an App Store release automatically. Credentials,
bundle IDs, Firebase app IDs, and Match configuration remain app/environment
owned. See `tool/release/README.md`.

## Localization

```bash
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=<id> make l10n
```

The script downloads a Google Sheets CSV, validates and converts it to ARB, then
runs Flutter localization generation. See `tool/l10n/README.md` for the expected
columns and optional sheet GID.

## Quality gates

```bash
make get
make codegen
make lint
make test
make setup-hooks   # optional local pre-commit and commit-message validation
```

Workspace scripts discover apps and packages rather than maintaining a hardcoded
Auth/Feed/Profile list. CI calls the same analyze, test, and codegen entry points.
Git hooks are opt-in and documented in `tool/quality/README.md`.

## Third-party services

When a real Map, Payment, Analytics, or Support SDK is needed, follow
`integrations/README.md`: define a provider-neutral contract, isolate the SDK in
a small adapter package, keep secrets/native settings app-owned, and supply a
fake for tests. The base deliberately does not ship unused provider packages.
