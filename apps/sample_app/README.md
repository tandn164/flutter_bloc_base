# Sample App

This Flutter application demonstrates how a product composes reusable feature
and shared packages. It is intentionally a thin composition root, not a source
of reusable business or infrastructure code.

## What remains app-owned

- bootstrap, flavors, theme, and native projects;
- GetIt registrations in `lib/app/di.dart`;
- GoRouter route names and tab order;
- product copy and callbacks passed into feature presentation packages;
- the capability showcase UI that triggers reusable base behavior.

Reusable behavior must be added to `features/`, `shared/`, or a real
`integrations/` package first, then consumed here.

## Run

```bash
make run APP=sample_app FLAVOR=dev
```

The **Capabilities** tab triggers overlays, connectivity policies, skeletons,
validation, logs, deep links, and onboarding. The **Sample list** tab is the
exception: it is a complete feature-first clean architecture example with BLoC,
pagination, pull-to-refresh, and optimistic mutations. It uses a deterministic
local repository rather than pretending to be a backend.

## Feature selection

Select feature dependency initializers in `lib/app/di.dart` and routes/tab
branches in `lib/app/router/app_router.dart`. There is no separate feature
manifest. Keep tab destinations in `app_shell.dart` aligned with branch order.
Each feature has one folder under `lib/app/features/<name>/`:

- `<name>_di.dart`: dependency registration only; imported by app `di.dart`.
- `<name>_routes.dart`: routes, page builders and callbacks; imported by `app_router.dart`.
- Generated `.config.dart` / `.g.dart` files live beside the source that owns them.

See [feature wiring](lib/app/features/README.md) for the current layout and usage.
Real providers belong in app composition or an
`integrations/` adapter; the sample app does not silently replace them with
fake implementations.

## Firebase configuration

Per-flavor Android and iOS configuration folders are already prepared. See
[FIREBASE.md](FIREBASE.md) before adding Firebase SDKs or release credentials.

## Validate

```bash
make codegen APP=sample_app
make lint APP=sample_app
make test APP=sample_app
```
